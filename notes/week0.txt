inputs and outputs
	Computers only understand things in binary
		humans use powers of 10, computers use powers of 2
		1 = 001
		2 = 010
		3 = 011
		4 = 100
		5 = 101
		6 = 110
		7 = 111
		8 = ...
		gonna need a new bit. short for binary digit (a 0 or a 1)

	How do you represent bits inside of a computer
		Take a lightbulb, it can either be on or off. you could 
		actually count to 1 with a lightbulb that simply turns
		on or off

		What if your lightbulb comes with an API. Or an 
		application programming interface. Now you can program
		your lightbulb and give it messages.

		If you have 8 bits you will have at most
		  1  1  1  1 1 1 1 1
		128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 which adds up to 255. 

		The number 50 could be represented as 
		  0  0  1  1 0 0 1 0
		128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

	What would the next step be after representing binary numbers
		Computers can map letters of the alphabet using ASCII
		These are a series of numbers which are interpreted as 
		letters
		H  I
		72 73

	Algorithms
		You pass algorithms inputs and they give you outputs. The
		trick is to make turn the inputs into the outputs efficiently

		Pseudocode
			Generic way of describing a computer program using plain 
			english

		Our Pseudocode
			1. pick up phone book
			2. open to middle of phone book
			3. look at names
			4. if "Smith" is among names
			5.		call Mike
			6. else if "Smith" is earlier in book
			7.		open to middle of left half of book
			8.		go to line 3
			9.	else if "Smith" is later in book
			10.		open to middle of right half of book
			11.		go to line 3
			12.	else
			13.		give up

			created this by considering all possible cases
				here there are 3
					mike can be to the right
					mike can be to the left
					mike is not in the book
				its good to think of cases as either
					general or
					edge

					for the number of people in a room
					general would be 5
					edge would be 0 or a million

	Variables
		A container that contains some value

	Loop
		A process in which you repeat something

		Commonly represented using 'for'

	Condition
		boolean that determines whether or not an action
		is to be taken

	Statement
		basically any command that tells the comp what to do
		ex// say "Hello World"

	Pseudocode for Peanut Butter and Jelly
		took 19 lines and it was hard to tell rob how to make
		the sandwhich

	pieces
		kickstart with "when (Green flag) clicked"

Binary
	When you learn numbers you learn 0123456789
		you can put these in combination to get numbers
		known as decimal notation cause decem = 10
	437 = 400 + 30 + 7
	    = 4 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 7 * 1
	    = 4 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + 7 * 10^0
	   	10 is the base
	If you only have (0 and 1) your base is going to be 2
		This is Binary cause bi = 2

Ascii
	You have 26 letters so represent 0-25 as a-z
	but you need upper and lowercase letters
		now you need an additional 26 numbers
	but you also need punctuation, digits 0-9, and a spacebar

	ASCII is 7 bit encoding, there are 2^7 or 128 characters
	that can be represented using the ASCII coding scheme
	a-z = 26
	A-Z = 26
	0-9 = 10
	./% = 32
	_   = 1
		= 95 total. only 33 characters left
	The rest of the characters are labeled control characters which
	used to be used for old messaging machines and
	0000000 and 1111111 are null and del respectively.
	Made for tape editing

Problems
	
	How do you represent the decimal integer 50 in binary?
		32 + 16 + 2
		110010

	How many bits must be flipped in order to capitalize a lowercase
	'a' that's represented in ASCII?
	A = 1100001
	a = 1000001 so only one bit, the 2^5 or 32nds bit has to be 
				flipped

	How do you represent the decimal integer 50 in hexadecimal?
		3 * 16 + 2 * 1
		32
