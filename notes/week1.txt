From Scratch to C
	Statements

	Functions

	Loops
		Computers are good at doing things over and over again

	Boolean Expression

	Conditions
		A statement that determines a decision

Story of Paul Allen and Bill Gates
	They wrote a program that basically allows people to write
	their own programs. They called it BASIC. It empowers people
	to write code which is more or less in plain english rather than
	in machine code. It was one of the first attempts to create
	an interpreter.

Source Code
	Unlike pseudo code

	#include <stdio.h>

	int main(void)
	{
		printf("Hello World!\n")
	}

Compiler
	Learn how to write source code, pass it into a compiler, that 
	produces object code
	source code --> compiler --> object code
	ex. int main(void) 				ex. 00011100

C
	printf("<Whatever you want to print>");

	int main(void)
		main

	loops
		while (true) 
		{
			printf("Hello World!\n");
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			printf("Hello World!\n")
		}

	Variables
		int counter = 0;
		while (true) {
			printf("%d\n", counter);
			counter++;
		}

	Boolean Expressions
		(x < y) or ((x < y) && (x < z))

	Conditions
		if (x < y) {
			printf("x is less than y\n");
		}
		else if (x > y) {
			printf("x is greater than y\n");
		} else  {
			printf("x is equal to y\n");
		}

		Libraries
			related prewritten code, use to chare code between
			people, programs, and processes

			C standard libraries
				common ones
					-input/output (stdio)
					-string (working with strings)
					-math (constants)
			Technical terms
				binary file produced by linking together object 
				files using a linker. Two types of files
				header files (*.h) and class files (*.c)
				contains code decaring
				the files resources that are available to use.
				This is known as the interface.
			Can check out library for stdio.h using
				$ less /usr/include/stdio.h

	Libraries
		Whats a library?
			A group of functions that you can use in your 
			program. Often used in C to communicate between
			programs, and programmers, and even threads.

		What role does #include <cs50.h> play when you write it 
		atop some program?
			Tells the compiler to go to the default file 
			usually /usr/include/ and look for the library 
			header files cs50.h. Once the compiler can see this
			it can check to see if you are implementing the
			library correctly or not.

		What role does -lcs50 play when you pass it as a command
		line argument to clang? (Recall that make, the program
		we've been using to compile programs in lecture simply 
		calls clang with some command line arguments to save you
		time.)
			-lcs50 tells the clang or clanguage compiler to
			include the cs50 library.

	Booleans
		Boolean Values
			True or False
		Boolean Operators
			AND, OR, NOT
		Boolean Expressions
			use parentheses for order of operations
		Syntax
			AND : &&
			OR  : ||
			NOT :  !

	Compilers
		When you compile something, you are taking it from a 
		high level programming language to a low level
		programming language

		Clang
			4 major steps
				1. preprocessing
					preprocessor
						clang -E only runs preprocessor
							copy and pastes everything from
							the header file
				2. Compilation
					compiler
						clang -S only runs the compiler
							you must pass this a preprocessed
							file.
				3. Assembly
					assembler
						clang -c only runs the assembler
							assembler takes in assembly and
							outputs machine code.
				4. Linking
					linker
						combines a bunch of object files into
						a single executable file.

		Make Clang
			make : is a program that automates the compiler for
			us.

			an executable - in binary format that the computer 
			can understand. 

			What actually happens to produce an executable
				make invokes the compiler clang followed by
				a number of options.

				clang <hello.c> -o hello
					outputs hello.c as hello. otherwise
					outputs hello.c as a.out and you have to
					use the mv a.out hello to rename
					the file

				clang -Wunused-variable
					warns if there is an unused variable

					instead of listing all warnings, you use
					clang -Wall aka Warnings, all

				clang -Werror forces clang to stop compilation
					if there is a warning.

				clang -ggdb
					enables special debugging information in
					the executable. Without this option
					its hard to examine information.

				clang -l 
					used to link libraries -lcs50 or -lm
					for the math library.

					if you write -l before your file name
					then the library is processed before the
					source code and cannot be used in it.
