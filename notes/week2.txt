Bug
	
	print ten stars
		use a for loop where i = 0; i <= 10; i++
			this prints 11 stars
		options
			i = 0; i < 10; i++
				or
			i = 1; i <= 10; i++

	print one star on ten lines
		for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
			printf("*");
			printf("\n");

		options
			use brackets, because if you have multiple lines
			you need braces, if you only have one line after
			the for loop then you can go without braces.

	Extremely critical crypto flaw in iOS and OS X
		Bug was in SSL (secure sockets later)
			browsers use this for encryption

			accidentally had one extra line after an if 
			statement without brackets so conditional
			logic was not correct.

		key point, low level details can be extremely important

		solving problems

	Functions

		You can write you own

		// first declare with a prototype
		void PrintName(string name);

		// you still run your program with the main function
		int main(void)
		{
			printf("Your name ");
			string s = GetString();
			PrintName(s);
		}
		
		// Define the function
		void PrintName(string name)
		{
			printf("hello, %s\n", name);
		}

		prototype syntax
			<return type> function(<input type> <input name>);

	Scope
		Variable can only be used inside the most recently opened
		and closed brackets

	Representation of information

		char 	character 	1 byte		256 possible characters

		int 	integer		4 bytes		4 billion possibilities

		float	real number	4 bytes		finite precision

		double	real number 8 bytes		finite but more precision

		long long	integer	8 bytes		larger than an int

		What is overflow
			If you overflow a byte thats been filled to
			255 all numbers will return to zero

		Float precision
			Imprecise because finite number of values, if there
			is an infinite number of real numbers, the computer
			cannot represent all of them, so it just gives you
			the number closest to what you were looking for.

			Consequences
				Scientfic rocket blew up

				128 soldiers died because patriot missle defence
				system failed.	

	Functions 2

		Functions take input, and use their functionality to
		do something sophisticated with them

	CS50 application

		Ubuntu linux

		GEdit
			Editor
			Terminal Window
				where you type commands, simplified UI
				not Graphical User Interface, rather a
				command line interface

				make hello
					takes input (source code) and converts
					it to object code

				./hello
					runs the file hello in the current directory

		#include <stdio.h>

			this line includes functions that were written in 
			the past

			says go find this file, and copy it and paste it
			above the contents of my current file

			contains printf()

		main
			the default entry point to a program

		{}
			encapsulate functionality

		printf
			a function

		() from printf()
			container that holds the inputs

		"hello, world\n"
			In C you have to surround a string with double 
			quotes.

		\n
			new line symbol

		;
			ends a statement

		Source Code
			passed to a compiler which outputs
				object code or a pattern of zeroes and ones

			take for granted that the command make produces
			the zeroes and ones

		Make actually calls clang

		clang hello.c
			will output a.out because this is generic name
			for the output of clang compiler

			when you compile hello.c you are only turning it
			into zeroes and ones

				cs50 staff compiled cs50's library into zeroes
				and ones. you need to specify that you want
				to combine the object files in your other
				program using -l<object file>

		clang -o <argument> <file to by compiled>
			names the output as <argument>

		printf 
			has several escape characters
				\n
				\r
				\'
				\"	useful because " usually denotes a string
				\\
				\0
				...

			has placeholders
				%c 		single character
				%d, %i 	integer
				%f 		floating point
			
		cs50 library
			has two types not actually in string
				bool
				string
			has functions
				GetChar
				GetDouble
				GetFloat
				GetInt
				GetLongLong
				GetString

	Adder.c
		Simple calculator that adds numbers
		#include <stdio.h>
		#include <cs50.h>

		int main(void)
		{
			printf("Give me an integer: ");
			int x = GetInt();
			printf("Give me antoehr integer: ");
			int y = GetInt();

			printf("The sum of %i and %i is %i!\n", x, y, x+y);
		}

Shorts
	
	Functions
		An encapsulated procedure
			Dont have to understand internals, just know
			how to use or call them

		int main(void)
			return type is used to communicate status of 
			program. Anything other than a 0 is an error
			returning different codes for different
			errors can be useful for anyone using your
			program.

	Cryptography
		A key = 1 A --> B
		A key = 3 A --> D
		cat key = 5
			C --> h
			a --> f
			t --> y

	Command Line Arguments
		ex. mv <arg1> <arg2> where arg1 = Source arg2 = Dest

		how do you tell your C program to utilize CLine args
			main accepts two parameters argc and argv[]

			argc or argument count has a datatype int
				contains the number of arguments included
				in the command

				argv[argc] is an array of char pointers

				argv[0] contains command being run i.e. mv
				argv[1] contains second command i.e. arg1
				argv[2] contains third command i.e. arg2

		syntax
			int main(int argc, char* argv[])
			{
				//to access elements in argv use a loop
				for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
					printf("argv[%d] is: %s\n", i, argv[i])
				return 0;
			}

		argv holds an array of char*
			how do we access individual characters in each
			argument

				need to apply a nested loop

		int main(int argc, char* argv[])
		{
			//to access elements in argv use a loop
			for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
				for(int j = 0; n = strlen(argv[i]); j < n; j++)
				printf("argv[%d][%d] is: %c\n", i,j argv[i][j])
			return 0;
		}

Problems

	How does a while loop differ from a do while loop?
	When is the latter particularly useful?

		A while loop does some specified action while a 
		condition is true. A do while loop does a specified
		action one time, then checks to see if the condition
		is true, and continues looping until that condition
		is false. A do while loop is especially useful
		when you want to do an action once, and then check
		to see if some condition based on that action is true.
		One example is getting proper input from the user.

	What does undeclared identifier usually indicate if
	outputted by make or really clang?

		Usually this means that you have a variable that has
		been declared inside of curly braces, but is trying
		to be accessed outside of the curly braces. On a more
		general note, it means that the compiler does not 
		recognize a variable name that you are using in your
		program.

	Why is Ceasar's cipher not very secure?

		Because there are only 26 possible iterations of the
		alphabet (including the correct one A, B, C ...) and
		a computer can easily cycle through thse until it
		spits out the proper output.

	Whats a function?

		A function is a code block which defines a procedure.
		Although not always the case, functions are generally
		given input which they use to derive an output. In all
		cases functions are a method of encapsulating code,
		providing increased readability and decreasing the need
		to retype commonly used blocks of code.

	Why bother writing functions when you can just copy and
	past code as needed?

		For many reasons. Functions increase the readability of 
		your code. Functions separate the implementation from
		the functionality. So the person using the function
		only need to understand the semantics of using the 
		function and not necessarily its inner workings. The 
		benefits of this can be seen even in the most common
		functions such as printf() which takes several
		hundred lines of code to implement. Furthermore, 
		functions reduce the need to copy and paste lines of
		code. If you used the printf() function 20 times in 
		some program, it is very useful for the programmer
		to have those functions which take up <=20 lines.
		Without functions, they would have thousands of lines
		of code that look extremely complicated but really only
		output text to the console.

	ASCII
		A = 65, a = 97
		Z = 90, z = 122

		you can loop through letters
		for (char c = 'A'; c <= 'Z'; c++)
			printf("%i is %c\n", (int) c, c);

		you can capitalize strings
		a string is an array of characters, so you can use
		square bracket notation
		for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++)
		{
			if (s[i] <= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z')
			{
				printf("%c\n", s[i] - ('a' - 'A'));
			}
			else
			{
				printf("%c", s[i])
			}
		}

Command line arguments
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* arvg[])
{
	// argc is argument count or the number of arguments
	// argv is argument vector
	printf("%s\n", argv[1]);
	// argv[0] has the programs actual name
}	

to print all the words 
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* arvg[])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
		printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
