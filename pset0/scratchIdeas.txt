Ideas
	Make sure that the octopus and crabs cannot spawn on top of the
	player. This is a bad experience. seems buggy when it happens.

	Work on developing a stronger running away algorithm for the 
	octopuses. 

	Possibly add another character, for example, starfish falling
	down the screen or even a shark. 

	Add lives, a scoreboard, create a way of scoring points

	Add different items other than the star, which would
	either grant the player points or let them tackle
	monsters in a new way. (Some ideas could be resizing the
	monsters, so they all shrink by 50%, another powerup could
	slow the monsters. Maybe create a weapon so the player
	can defend himself. )
